The authors of Network Mom ACL Analyzer do not want your private information and do not collect your information via the Network Mom ACL Analyzer.

Network Mom ACL Analyzer uses Apple's "App Sandbox" feature and does _not_ enable incoming or outgoing network connections.
It only allows read-only access to files which the user selects. The application does not even save ACL information between
application runs.

Network Mom ACL Analyzer uses Apple's "Hardened Runtime" feature and does _not_ enable any exceptions to the hardened runtime.

These settings prevent the Network Mom ACL Analyzer from harvesting your private information.

Precompiled Network Mom ACL Analyzer versions distributed via darrellroot's GitHub releases go through Apple's application
notarization service with very restrictive app sandbox and hardened runtime settings.
