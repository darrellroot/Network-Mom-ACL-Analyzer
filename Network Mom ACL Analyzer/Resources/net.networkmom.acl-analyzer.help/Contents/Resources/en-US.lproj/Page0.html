            <span class="Normal">Network Mom ACL Analyzer is a tool to help network administrators understand if a specific socket is already permitted or denied by a Cisco® IOS®, IOS-XE®, IOS-XR®, NX-OS, or ASA access-list.  Network Mom ACL Analyzer can also analyze Arista Networks® EOS® IPv4 and IPv6 access-lists.  Production access-lists can be thousands of lines long, making a tool essential for solving this problem.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Left Normal">
            <span class="Normal">In addition, Network Mom ACL Analyzer reviews the ACL and can find some errors in ACL configurations.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Left Normal">
            <span class="Normal">Network Mom ACL Analyzer can also search for “duplicate” ACL lines.  If a prior line matches a strict superset of a later line, the relationship is reported.  This lets you decide whether to remove the duplicate or investigate the overly permissive prior line.</span>

        <p class="Left Normal">
            <span class="Normal">If you find an ACL that this tool does not analyze correctly, please email feedback@networkmom.net a sample so we can fix it!  We also welcome ACL samples for IPv6 and other platforms to help our development.  If you want your platform supported, send us some ACL samples!</span>
